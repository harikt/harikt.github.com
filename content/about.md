Hey,

I am Hari KT, a Freelancer residing in God's own country, Kerala, India.

An open-source lover and have contributed code, documentation and $$.

I mostly work with PHP. But that has not stopped me learning new languages or technologies.

And I got some opportunity to work with Golang, Python, Scrapy etc.

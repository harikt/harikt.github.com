Some days back I wrote about a WIP of 
[The Book on Aura](http://harikt.com/blog/2013/07/09/the-book-on-aura/)

It got some attention and pull requests.

[Akihito Koriyama](https://github.com/koriym/the-book-on-aura-ja) 
have already started to convert the documentation to Japanese.

And today I am happy to announce that it is officially going to the 
manuals.

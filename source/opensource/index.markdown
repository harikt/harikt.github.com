I love open-source, and believe in the policy of give and take. Have 
contributed code, money, bug reporting, help in irc, google groups,
stackoverflow in my freetime.

## Aura

My favourite and the most contributed one is [Aura][]. It is the second major version of 
[SolarPHP][], with one goal "libraries first, framework second".

Started my contribution from silly questions, 
bug reporting, patches and later to be part of the great team.
I am especially grateful to work with [Paul M Jones][] who is 
an internationally recognized PHP expert.

There are lots of open-source projects in [github.com](http://github.com) . I love contibuting to open-source projects. It may not be that much easy as github. But it didn't happened until I did a pull request to [AuraPHP](https://github.com/auraphp). I was really excited that it was merged with more changes made by [Paul MÂ Jones](http://paul-m-jones.com/) .  So if you are interested like me to contribiute or to make the project more shiny fork it [http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)  Do your changes and make a pull request [http://help.github.com/pull-requests/](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)  Enjoy !

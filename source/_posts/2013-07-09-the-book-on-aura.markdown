There has been lot of requests to show how the individual packages 
in aura, can be made use inside the framework.

So today I am happy to announce that there is a work in progress 
to make the framework documentation better. I have already started 
the work on the same.

You can [read the chapters online](http://harikt.com/the-book-on-aura/).

The examples used in the book are also online at  
[https://github.com/harikt/Example.Package](https://github.com/harikt/Example.Package)


> I hope Something is better than nothing.

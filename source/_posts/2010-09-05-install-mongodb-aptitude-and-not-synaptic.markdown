[![Mongo Db](%20http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4959237021_38f1029ac5.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4959237021/)  I thought of playing with [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org), one among the No SQL movement. I am using Ubuntu 10.04 . Installed via **synaptic** , installed some GUI admin tools like [phpmoadmin](http://www.phpmoadmin.com/) , [opricot](http://www.icmfinland.fi/oss/opricot/) (Both these tools are not necessary , just installed those to see how it works on browser ) . Opened my favourite terminal , just typed $**mongod**  mongod: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  Wow got some nice errors . I was stuck with it and googled and moved through various blgs and forums . From [one of the group posts](http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/7e7fd7fa0313c326?tvc=2&pli=1) I recognised the ubuntu package is broken and you need to install via the [aptitude after adding the repository](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages) . But I have another one which I have not tried , I feel it will work , so you can have a look into [JuriTallinn's blog](http://dracoater.blogspot.com/2010/08/mongodb-with-c-in-ubuntu.html) before trying the below one, if you have already installed via synaptic.  So I just edited the **/etc/apt/sources.list** file . You can use either vi or gedit , and add the line      deb http://downloads.mongodb.org/distros/ubuntu 10.4 10gen  Save it and run  $ aptitude update  You may get some error like W: GPG error: http://downloads.mongodb.org 10.4 Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO\_PUBKEY 9ECBEC467F0CEB10 . If you get something like this just run  $ apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10  And once again run  $ aptitude update   Hope everything works fine . Just run aptitude install and install stable , development or what ever version you love. I am installing a stable one .  $ aptitude install mongodb-stable  Now you can run your favorite mongodb from cmd line via  $mongo  And have fun . I also downloaded the [PECL driver for PHP](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php) which is explained below.  You need to download the php5-dev package before you run . You can use aptitude or synaptic. After the php5-dev installation run  $ pecl install mongo  and adding the line in php.ini . You may be having 2 php.ini if you have installed cli interface also . It will be located at /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini , /etc/php5/cli/php.ini . If you are unsure where it is just use locate command.  $ locate php.ini  Add the below line in php.ini      extension=mongo.so  Restart your apache ;) . Done and have fun with Mongo .

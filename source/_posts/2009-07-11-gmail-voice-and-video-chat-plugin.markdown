Gmail has introduced the voice and video chat for a while .Â  But its still not available for GNU/Linux . The screenshot of it when I checked for the plugin is given below .  ![gmail voice and video chat plugin](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2620/3709843567_1253d9e49c.jpg?v=0)  Google has announced the Google Chrome OS in the 2010 , which will be running on the top of Linux Kernel . I am hoping that the voice and video chat will be available from 2010 for GNU/Linux systems .

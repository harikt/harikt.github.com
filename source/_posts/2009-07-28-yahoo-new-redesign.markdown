I recently read some where the design of yahoo is being changing . The new CEO has asked for the new design . Yes today I was really excited to see the new design . Every one loves a change, and I love the design in the first look itself . Its having wonderful features like Gmail , AOL mail preview .  ![Yahoo new look](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2510/3763740060_d66f08047d.jpg)  ![Old yahoo home page](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2645/3762945469_79148306a6.jpg)  Just took the screen shot of the old and new look for you . I hope every one will love the new look .

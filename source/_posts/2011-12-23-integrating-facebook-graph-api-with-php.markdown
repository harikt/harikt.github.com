Recently ( around September ) I got a chance to write for Sitepoint's phpmaster.com. I wrote how we can [intergrate Facebook Graph API with PHP](http://phpmaster.com/integrating-with-facebook/) . You can read the article over phpmaster. Thanks to Timothy Boronczyk ( Editor at phpmaster.com ) for giving me an opporchunity to write. Hope you will enjoy the article.

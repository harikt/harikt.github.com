Many of the web developers used to work on windows . The reasons they are used to work are  1 ) Cross browser compatibility : The world wide web is used by different people around the world. You may be an GNU/Linux fan , but people who browse your web pages may be using Internet Explorer. Mozilla firefox is the wondeful browser , that every developer may have seen. It can recognize the css and do the correct things . Safari also recognise to some extent . But what about IE ? hm its a tedious job for the designers and web developers . Some of the css will not be accepted by IE. So when developing a web site we may need to look in different web browsers and test whether it looks the same in all .  2 ) Dreamweaver : Many web developers may be using dream weaver for developing their sites. Dream weaver ofcourse is a wonderful tool . But is a properitery one :-( .  3 ) Photoshop : Many designers may be familiar with photoshop , and have not tried GIMP of the GNU / Linux. I would like to introduce you the wonderful tool GIMP to the web designers. I don't know whether you lacks any features. But be proud of using GPL or Open source softwares.     ![Kompozer a wysiwyg editor](http://harikt.com/images/banners/Kompozer_wysiwyg_editor.png "Kompozer a wysiwyg editor") If you using GNU/Linux you may be looking for a dreamweaver like editor . Yes there are a lots of editors in GNU/Linux. Some are vim , emacs, gedit etc. But what about a Graphical User Interface one ? Yes, there a plenty too like the Quanta plus , Blue Fish , Netbeans etc. But misses some in each and every one . Recently I found a wonderful WYSIWYG editor .

I found this tool as a wonderful one . So like you to help you , if you are looking for one like this . If you have any other good editors which you know for the GNU/Linux then let me know .

I have combined the basic things that are needed when you are developing a website using zend framework . Not included the zend framework library . This zfbase contains an admin module and a default module ( [Nick Belhomme](http://blog.nickbelhomme.com) technique ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) ) .  It also uses the [amazium blog](http://amazium.be/) technique ( Jeroen Keppens ) to load the different layout for admin and front page .  If you need to connect to a db just uncomment the line in the application.ini of config directory and give the necessary details . This was a technique I learned from Rob Allen author of the book "zend framework in action" , zend framework educaton advisory board member and owner of the site [akrabat](http://akrabat.com) .  I hope these files can be just copied to start another project . You don't want to issue the command zf create project <project name\> any more ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . You can still use zf command to generate contollers and actions . Many of you may be having your own zend framework skelton . This is for those who don't have one and who is looking to learn how module , layout etc works in zend framework .  The zfbase skelton contains an admin module where you can place admin models and controllers . Default module the same as that of quickstart , not having any difference . So this will help newbie to zend-framework . You don't need to spend any more time googling . All you need is to get this and start your zend framework project .  There are many techniques , this is one way that you can do it . If you have some other nice way share and let others learn that technique too .  Tweet ( \#zfbase , tinyurl : [http://bit.ly/1y5me](http://bit.ly/1y5me "http://bit.ly/1y5me") ) this if you liked it . Don't forget to [promote this link in dzone](http://www.dzone.com/links/zend_framework_skelton_for_newbies_to_start_your.html) . You don't want to pay anything for writing comments , then why are you waiting ?.  Thanks to zend framework and all zend framework bloggers who are helping .

I was little busy with different things. Sometimes with [Aura](http://auraphp.github.com/). So it took sometime to inform you that the second book [Wordpress 3 Ultimate Security](http://www.packtpub.com/wordpress-3-ultimate-security/book) I have reviewed is available .  If you was following me in [Google +](https://plus.google.com/103027363195624770971/posts/iyGbNtMpXQY) or Twitter you may have already known this. Its a nice book, you will definitely learn how to secure your site.

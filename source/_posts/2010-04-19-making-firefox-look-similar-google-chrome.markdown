If you have used google chrome , you may have loved its simple menu, navigation etc. I love to make firefox somthing similar to google chrome .  Some firefox addons is necessary to change mozilla firefox look somthing similar to google chrome .  [![make firefox having google chrome look](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4532378436_76b73c6a55.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532378436/ "make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr")  Addons Needed  1 ) We need to hide the menu, so you can download [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762)  2 ) Download Personnas , so you can dress mozilla firefox in different looks . You can get it from [http://www.getpersonas.com/](http://www.getpersonas.com/)  After downloading and installing addons, you need to restart firefox .  Steps involved  1 ) Tick only the navigation toolbar , ie Goto Views -\> Toolbars -\> Click on Navigation Toolbar ( If the menu is not showing you can use Alt + F , Alt + T, Alt + v , will make you jump to Views menu or use your favourite short cut keys )  2 ) Customize your navigation tool bar . ie Goto Views -\> Toolbars -\> Customize  [![make firefox having google chrome look](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4532380282_435c3ee8c2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532380282/ "make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr")  Here you can drag and dropthe things from the navigation . ie where we type the url and all . The left side buttons are draggable and dropped the other window . Try draggind and dropping  .  3 ) Enable Groovy Blue theme for the personnas ( for the bueish look ) or you can create a small image of the same colour of google chrome navigation  and dress your browser, creating new personnas :).  So the final look will be something like the one I showed at the top. Hope you like it :) .

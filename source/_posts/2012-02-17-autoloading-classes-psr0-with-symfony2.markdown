Recently I wrote a post on how autoloading works, and the current standard implemented by the PHP community the PSR-0 standard autoloader which is used by Symfony2 , Lithium , Zend , Aura etc .  You can read more on the post [Autoloading in PHP and the PSR-0 Standard](http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/) .  If you are using PHP 5.4 , [Aura Autoload](http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Autoload/) also provides a [PSR-0 Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) SPL autoloader implementation for PHP. It also matches the proposed [SplClassLoader](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/splclassloader) interface.  Thank you once again for sitepoint and the whole team giving me an opporchunity to make this post available to you.

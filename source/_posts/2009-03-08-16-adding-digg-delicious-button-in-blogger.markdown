Though I heard about open social networks, I doesn't gave much importance to these sites . But now I learned some facts . So was looking how I can add a digg-it , del.icio.us button in blogger. Though there are many thought of adding these two. Only successful in adding one. Working on the del.icio.us for now .  First login to your blogger account goto Settings-\>Archiving and look whether enable post pages is set to yes. Else make it yes and save the settings.  Then goto Layout-\>Edit HTML  You can download a backup. It will be good to keep your settings safe if anything goes wrong . Click Download Full Template and save it in your system.  Now you will be seeing the template in a text area . Tick Expand Widget Templates, that will add additional informations to the currently shown template in text area.  If you are using Mozilla Firefox , can quickly search for "data:post.body" by using ctrl + f .  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> <data:post.body/\> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> </div\>  Add the below code above or below. Hope you have some knowledge of HTML and css .  <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg\_url="<data:post.url/\>"; </script\> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> </div\>  The complete code after doing so is given below.  <div class='post-body entry-content'\> <div style='float:right; margin-left:10px;'\> <script type='text/javascript'\> digg\_url="<data:post.url/\>"; </script\> <script src='http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js' type='text/javascript'/\> </div\> <data:post.body/\> <div style='clear: both;'/\> <!-- clear for photos floats --\> </div\>  Save and see the Digg in action .  You can see the Digg in action at [http://ijust4u.blogspot.com](http://ijust4u.blogspot.com "Digg in action at ijust 4 u")  Working on del.icio.us for now. Will add it soon after success .

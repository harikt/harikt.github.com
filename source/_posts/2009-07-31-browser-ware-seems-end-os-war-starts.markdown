It seems the browser war is ending, but the OS ( Operating System ) war begins . Microsoft may be the worst to hit in the market with the introduction of Google Chrome OS which will be running on top of Linux Kernel . Microsoft seems to be working hard for the new OS Windows 7 .  I heard that with the introduction of Google Chrome OS the sale of Microsoft Vista has been effected . Don't know how much fact is there . Some of the GNU/Linux guys even thinks whether there is a new distro needed .  Anyway I am waiting to see the new Google Chrome OS in 2010 . Also hoping many of the products of google will be ported to run on GNU/Linux OS . For eg : gtalk , chrome browser etc .

There are various distribution of GNU/Linux available now. I think every disto have a Live CD . So people can try it out and if they love it , can install it . So what I am talking is, it may not be possible to create a Live CD to try each and every distro and their newer versions . If you are a person like me , then you may love to use an alternative to boot from CD, something like a USB flash drive ( popularly called pen drive , thumb )  for its reusable .  Some days before I found the new GNU/ Linux which is entirely free removing all the restricted packages which is supported by the FSF ( Free software foundation) . Gnewsense is an Ubuntu based free software distribution without non-free binary blobs in the kernel. You may think whether Ubuntu is a free one , then why gnewsense . If you have any such doubts you can have a look in the [FAQ of the gnewsense .](http://www.gnewsense.org/index.php?n=FAQ.FAQ "FAQ of the gnewsense")  [![gnewsense desktop](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3491574392_a807a17c45.jpg?v=0 "gnewsense desktop")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3491574392/)    [![gnewsense desktop with applications](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/3491575834_a0206ca88e.jpg?v=0 "gnewsense desktop with applications")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3491575834/)       Though I uses Ubuntu , I want to try it out, so thought of downloading the iso and use from USB pen drive . There was a documentation in the gnewsense about [booting gnewsense gnu/linux from usb](http://wiki.gnewsense.org/Documentation/BootingFromUSB) . I worked as they have written . Though I am not powerful in those commands I thought of learning the new commands . Fallen to trouble partitioning USB and all . And finally recovered every thing and restarted after finishing all the steps.  When it started I changed to boot from USB flash drive . But got a black screen with just a message error . What to do now . Changed to other usb ports , the same ( error booting gnewsense ) . hm........ Anyway I want to try it, booted to Ubuntu connected net and searched , I don't find an answer for it . Anyway got another software Free USB installer ( Either youu can try http://aligunduz.org/FUSBi/ or usb-creator . usb-creator is a good choice for the aligunduz . Download the usb-creator using synaptic and issue the command usb-creator in terminal . A graphical view will appear . [Read more from ubuntu help](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick) ) from iso package. Free USB installer can install iso image to usb flash drive . Yes downloaded it, and tried it. Restarted again , now it works . Now its pretty simple booting gnu/linux from usb flash drive . Yes , I would like to express my Thanks to Mr Ali for his wonderful work . Yes it may have saved many people. I guess if users are not powerful in command line too or don't know the basics or some times to people who may have failed like me ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . Anyway failure is not the end, its the begining ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif) .

You can see how it looks . What I feel after working with it is, there is not much difference in menu and all, but a good color for the selection . Improved graphics . You too can try it from usb . Cheers guys , Have a great day .

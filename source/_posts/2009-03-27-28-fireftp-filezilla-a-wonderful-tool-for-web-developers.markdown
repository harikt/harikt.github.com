If you are a web developer or a server admin always communicating to download / upload files, then the Fire FTP is a wonderful addon for the Mozilla Firefox. Some times you may not be having enough permission to install the software . Then you may be trying to contact admin or some one to get it. But don't ask any body . Go and get the addon for Mozilla Firefox. Yes, its pretty easy and is a wonderful one . You may love to use it from the browser itself. FTP in one tab and the remaining pages in another . Don't need to switch from one FTP client to browser. Is it easy ?  Another FTP client is the Filezilla. Its also a great tool for web developers. Please do try these and you may love it .

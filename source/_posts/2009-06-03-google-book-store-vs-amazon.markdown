Hello friends, Many of you may have heard of google book search. It was active for a past few years. There were some cases registered by the authors, bcoz there was a preview of the book.  Now google has reached on a compromise with authors and the publishers. It was easy for me to read some of the books from google book search . The google book search is now expanding. Many of the books are out of print.  Google is making the necessary things to make it available online. People can buy the books from google. I think Amazon may be the first to hit, if google launch this service. You can read more about the google books from[http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/](http://books.google.com/googlebooks/agreement/)

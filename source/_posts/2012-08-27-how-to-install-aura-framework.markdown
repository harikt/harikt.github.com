This video is my an attempt to help the people how to install the aura framework as a whole. Note, you can use aura libraries independently also. This is my first screencast on aura and first screencast I have ever done. So feedback is appreciated. I am using record my desktop for recording.  I was having some trouble with vimeo, so have uploaded to youtube. Thanks for watching.

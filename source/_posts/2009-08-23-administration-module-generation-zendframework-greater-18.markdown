Hello Guys  Are you new to Zend Framework ? Are you new to MVC ?  Then really you may have thought like me . Where to start and how to start ? Am IÂ right ?  Then this is post is for you my dear friend . I can admit one thing that learning Zend framework is hard though there is a big documentation . There is good examples to the components too . But we will not understand how to bind each other ? Am I right ?  I am also new to Zend Framework . I like the ZF command line most. I looked for many articles , but many was in the old style . Recently I came to a pdf document which was very interesting which is used to administer the site . Every one will look for how to create an admin side using zend frameowork greater than 1.8 . Now its 1.9 too .  I am keeping the pdf which was seen from Slideshare by [Nick Belhomme](http://blog.nickbelhomme.com/). This is a great one for each and every one to start . Hope it may help you . There are many more people who writes about Zendframework in their blog. I recently created a search to search those sites which I think may be helpful to you too . So you can explore it too . The link is [http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=005733697890798280623:f49mfrxmsje)  Good Luck guys . Explore the search engine and grab the Zend Framework .  Bye for now . You can see some from me too in the coming days . lol  Have created the base files need to start your zend framework project .

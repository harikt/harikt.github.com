Tody I noticed a strange behaviour today in the jquery website .  [![jquery](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4582450256_450db3d7e8_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4582450256/ "Mootools doc in jquery website")  In the most popular plugin section links to the mootools docs appeared. You can see from the screenshot . I wondered for a few seconds how it came in the site ? Not sure any one else noticed it .

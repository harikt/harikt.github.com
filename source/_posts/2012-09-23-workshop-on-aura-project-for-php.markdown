I am really excited and at the same time a bit nervous, that I will be giving a workshop on [aura project for PHP](https://github.com/auraphp) at [osidays](http://www.osidays.com/), which will be held at NIMHANS convention center Bangalore on 12-14 th of October 2012. I have received only the confirmation call, but not any mail as of now. If you have never heard of osidays, its one of the Asia's largest open-source conference held. The workshop will be for around 3 Hours. I will be walking you through different components of aura and finally to show how you can use the individual libraries as a framework. If you have never heard about the aura project, its an independent library which can be dropped at any codebase. You can find the source code and more information of the project at [https://github.com/auraphp](https://github.com/auraphp) . I know 3 Hours of continuous speech is a huge challenge. I will try my level best to make the workshop interesting. I will be also discussing with [Paul M Jones](http://paul-m-jones.com) how I can make it more informative. In-order to attend the workshop I feel you need to grab the platinum pass. Looking forward meeting you guys at osidays :) .

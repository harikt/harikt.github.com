I was thirsty to learn a framework . It was a tough job selecting a framework too . There is a lot of frameworks for PHP . Good programming starts when you start using frameworks ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . My friend Jose Antony suggested some of them . They are  [ZendFramework](http://framework.zend.com) : A powerful one by the PHP company Zend . Now with 1.8 there is RAD introduced . Thanks to Zend\_Tool .  [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org) : RAD framework by Sensiolabs . An exceptionally good documentation . Any one who is new to MVC can easily understand .  [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) : Many forum posts tell its easy to learn .  [Codeignitter](http://codeigniter.com) : Many symfony users have switched to codeignitter . [Sajith MR](http://www.sajithmr.com/symfony-vs-codeigniter/) in his blog posted also tells about why he moved from symfony to codeignitter . There may be many more guys posted about it .  [Yii](http://yiiframework.com) : A new flexible one .  ![Zend Framework in Action](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3748559244_ce4acd5e72.jpg?v=0)Finally my choice was zend-framework and now I am loving it . As I am new to the new MVC architecture it was little bit tough for me ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif). But recently I found a wonderful tutorial by [Rob Allen](http://akrabat.com/) the author of the book [ZendFramework in action](http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/) . The tutorial is an easy to learn who are new to zend-framework 1.8 .  I was not person who used to read books in my college days too . But now adays it seems I am reading a lot ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) .  ![PHP in Action](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/3747769765_2ca82aefc3.jpg?v=0)  [Zend framework in action](http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/) is one of the books I love to read . I hope the book zend framework in action is one of the best books to learn Zend framework . He was the advisory board member of Zend . So you can guess the remaining standard of the book .If you consider buying one , go for it . (\*I don't get any money for it , never think so )  I saw another book PHP in action when I was looking more details about Zend Framework in Action . Just looked the table of contents . Yes it also a wonderful one if you are new to PHP .  Also the book is just a starting point , you need to look the mannual pages of [php.net](http://php.net) and [framework.zend.com](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/) to learn more .  Today I found another site which is also a good one to start . Its none other than Zend Cast . Its having lots of videos for beginners . You may love it and learn from it .

Its a wonderful book to learn Zend framework and many components . The book covers many commonly used components like Zend\_ACL , Zend\_Auth , Zend\_Db , Zend\_Form etc . Its really a nice book which will speedup your learning curve . You can also learn zend framework from the mannuals, but it may be easy to follow a person who is using zend framework than going single . The book covers a working example creating a shopping cart . It also uses good programming practices like unit testing with phpunit , debugging with xdebug etc . You can get a copy of the book from [packt publishers](http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_000989). Its available in ebook and hardcopy . You will defnitely get the return once you have the book .  Hope you too will enjoy reading the book like me . I have posted my review [here](http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development) .

Everyone has been hearing the buzz REST. As web services and api for websites are becoming popular, all are busy developing REST api's for their websites. What exactly is REST? REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture for distributed systems such as the World Wide Web. REST has emerged over the past few years as a predominant Web service design model. This is what wiki mentions . The book REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé; O'Reilly Media will teach you some rules which needs to be followed. This book has really helped me to understand some of the basic concepts of HTTP protocol. Yes really I was able to understand more on REST and how it should be represented etc. Probably you would have noticed websites with format .html , .json , .xml . If you have ever thought its REST, then its not :-) . Do you know a trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs ? Underscores (\_) should not be used in URIs ? There are more rules , but you can read and learn the rest from the book. The book has a total of 94 pages, but will serve you for a good reference. It also introduces WRML (http://www.wrml.org/) . Cons : Yes I feel there are some cons for the book. There are some examples when introducing WRML like the one below . {syntaxhighlighter class="html"} application/wrml; format="http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json"; schema="http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player" {/syntaxhighlighter} But when you point your browser to http://api.formats.wrml.org/application/json you will get a 404. Example url : Its always a good way to mention example.com than mentioning http://api.schemas.wrml.org/soccer/Player . There are at many places its happening . You will not get completely on a first read when the chapters are moving, but sometimes you may want to read it many times. But I loved this book for I learned some basic stuffs really and also this is always a reference for future. In a rating of 5 , I will rate 4 . If you are interested in this book, you can buy this from REST API Design Rulebook by Mark Massé : http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021575.do Pages: 116 Print ISBN:978-1-4493-1050-9 | ISBN 10:1-4493-1050-8

In this tutorial I am showing how to install aura framework project v2 
via composer.

    composer create-project -s beta aura/framework-project path-to-project

[Aura.Framework_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework_Project) helps 
you to build web and cli applications.

If you need only web based application then 
[Aura.Web_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web_Project) 
is what you need.

If you need only cli, then [Aura.Cli_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli_Project) helps you.

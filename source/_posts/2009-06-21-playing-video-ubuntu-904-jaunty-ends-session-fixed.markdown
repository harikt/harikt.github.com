I have updated my Ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04 in the previous month . After the update I was facing a problem when playing videos . When we plays a video the user is being logged out . It was a strange one . I looked the forum , yes many have reported the bug. As I will not be using mainly to view video I thought of not considering the issue much .  But today I was forced to fix for I want to play a movie . What to do with the bug ?Â  ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif) . As every one do I go for a google ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/whatchutalkingabout_smile.gif) . Yes I got the solution and its working fine .  These are the things you must do .  Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and add the lines ( You must be root to do this . Eg: From terminal $ sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.lst ) You can use either vim or gedit or your favourite editor . I am using terminal .  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  $ sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79  $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4  Just restart your system . Hope it will work for you too .  For a better understanding of the following please do look the source from where I got the information .  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889 "Playing video logs out")  [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4 "Fix for the end session playing video in ubuntu")  \*Do at your own risk . Don't blame me if it doesn't works for you .

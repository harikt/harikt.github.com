I am really excited to hear that google is coming with the new google chrome OS which will be running on the top of a Linux Kernel . Its completely opensource . The news about it was published in the [googles official blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html)Â  2009 will be rocking with google wave and 2010 with google chrome OS ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) .  I can't wait to see it in action , hope every one will be looking forward for the release of it . One of my collegue was telling me that google will soon introduce the OS. Now it has become a truth .

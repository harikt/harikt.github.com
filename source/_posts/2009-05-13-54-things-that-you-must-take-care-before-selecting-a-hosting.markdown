Yes, when you are new to webhosting, then I am sure you may fall in trouble . You may be looking for cheap hosting , which may not be reliable. If your site doesn't get much traffic , then it may not be a big deal . But when your site is getting some what hits , then you may need to call each and every time your hosting service provider.  Some of the things must be taken in to consideration when you are moving for web hosting . Never go for the cheapest hosting. That doesn't means when the cost is high they give good support ![Cool](plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif "Cool") . The cheapest hosting is provided to you by means of VPS .A VPS is really for small developers , but some times hosting companies make use of this . The load will be balanced to every VPS , even though one of the VPS guys ask for increase in memory or any .  Ask your friends who are some what familiar with web hosting or servers. My friend Prajith was very helpful to find me a good solution. Though there were some troubles occured , they resolved the problem quickly. The support is the one that you need. When they don't turn up to answer you , it will be some what horrible .  **Fake content :** This is the one thing that you must consider , when you are looking for hosting or finding some business outside your country . I can write what ever things like, I was born on 1970 or I have started this site from 2000 onwards or something. But some of the things can be looked if you know . For eg : When some firms says we are here from 1995 onwards , then the best way to know is just a whois look up. I used to look for whois to get some information . Alexa is another solution that you can try . You can try and know the fake guys . So this is one of the important thing that you must take into consideration . I have seen some fake contents like this . But I know how to know , but sometimes you may fall in trouble if you don't know.  You can look for the forum if , you don't know a friend who is familiar.  I can also help you to find a good solution as my site is proudly hosted at [http://rackloop.com/](http://rackloop.com/) . Although they are new , they have great knowledge working with servers. These guys are great and you will love their support . You can see how fast my site is loaded , even though its Joomla and some seo friendly htaccess tricks are used.

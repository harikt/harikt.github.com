One of my friend was working with PHPMotions. Though I was aware of CMS systems , I have not thought of a Video CMS to create a youtube like clone site. I dont know why I have not thought of it still I use youtube and all ?  Anyway now I thinks about it . Yes something deep . I want to experiment with  some especially the video sections. My search starts when I start knowing about phpmotions. I searched for video cms systems. Some where nice in the demos. But all are paid softwares. Phpmotions is a freeware , but its not registered under the GNU/GPL licence. It has its own licence. But I searched for a GNU/GPL licenced one.  But my search ends when I see PHP Director . Yes we can have our own video site. Its under GPL Licence too . It has lots of features , but missing some , but in the next versions it will cover almost all that you need . I was interested to see and I would like to work on it. I will be busy with the next 2 weeks with my supplementary exams . After that I will be back , to work with the php director . They will be adding me to the developers. So in the next versions you can see some more improved features what we the phpdirector team will be introducing . I am extremely Happy to hear from them that I will be added to the team . Thanks Krissy & Ben  You can see a working section of the phpdirector at [**http://phpdirector.harikt.com**](http://phpdirector.harikt.com "PHP Director the free video CMS to your site"). This is not the official demo of php director , so the contents and look may change from the real one . :) So you can download and try it , that may be better too . PHP director is at [http://www.phpdirector.co.uk](http://www.phpdirector.co.uk "Official site of phpdirector")

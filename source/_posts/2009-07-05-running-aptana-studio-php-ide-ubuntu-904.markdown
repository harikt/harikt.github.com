Aptana is an opensource PHP Development IDE . I thought of learning an IDE for development . Habeeb one of my collegue have helped to learn more about Aptana . My system was a 64 bit Intel Core 2 Duo Processor .  I downloaded Aptana Studio stand alone app for Ubuntu 9.04 . I tried to run it , and got an error "/home/hari/Aptana Studio/.meta/.log" which describes the error report . I opened the .log file but could not trace it out . I searched google and found Aptana is not supporting 64 bit . First I thought it may be the problem because my OS is 64 bit . I downloaded the Aptana Stand alone for Eclipse . And I was having some more trouble configuring it .  Finally I thought of looking whether the Ubuntu 9.04 installed is 32 bit or 64 bit . I tried uname -a . You can also check the forum [http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html)  $uname -a Linux hari-opensource 2.6.27-7-generic \#1 SMP Fri Oct 24 06:42:44 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux  Got the above output . I was able to recognise that mine is a 32 bit version installed ( If you are running a 64 bit Ubuntu you will be getting something like x86\_64 in the above line ). Hm then why Aptana doesn't run ?  I looked the link once more [http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing\_Aptana\_on\_Linux](http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux) . We need to install xulrunner , although xulrunner 1.9 is installed. Add an additional file call it "add" or some thing you like and insert the below 2 lines into it .* *  *export MOZILLA\_FIVE\_HOME=/usr/lib/xulrunne *  */usr/local/aptana/AptanaStudio*  Make the file executable . ie chmod 777 <filename that you have named\> Eg :   $chmod 777 add  $./add  It will work fine for you . Any doubts just leave a comment. Will reply to you soon .

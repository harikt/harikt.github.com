I have registered an account for google voice some weeks before. Today I got an invitation from the google team . I was really excited to see it . With in a few seconds I clicked the link to test it . I got the login screen which asks for my password again though I am logged into gmail .  ![Login screen to google voice](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2521/3742249876_e74336d736.jpg?v=0)  I logged into it . But alas it just shows me a screen . its not in your country and its only for US now , and in the future will be available  .  ![Google voice is not available in your country](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3450/3742249870_3677ccf1de.jpg?v=0)  Hm I was thinking, if its not for India now then why do they need to send an invitation . The google has geoip to find from where a user is browsing . So they can ignore me . May be the coder doesn't utilises those great function . Anyway Thanks to google for the nice invitation .

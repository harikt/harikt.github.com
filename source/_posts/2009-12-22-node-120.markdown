[![kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/)I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can [import zend framework libraries in Kohana](http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries) . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the [tutorial of Kohana 3](http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/) which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  [![Lithium PHP 5 framework](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/)That's all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don't know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from [http://li3.rad-dev.org/](http://li3.rad-dev.org/) . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says [to codeigniter guys](http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270) "Dear \#CodeIgniter People, Don't you care that it's almost 2010 and you're still running PHP4 code? Yours, - Nate" and he got a [reply from Chris Cornutt](http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250) of [phpdeveloper.org](http://phpdeveloper.org) "@nateabele it's okay...we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)" . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version ~~0.5~~ 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don't remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see [http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions](http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions) . You can see how fast its moving .

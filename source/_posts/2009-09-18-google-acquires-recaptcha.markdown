[![reCAPTCHA](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2591/3931206160_ce8a948f2e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3931206160/)Today I saw a post in Googles official blog about their acquasition of recaptcha . Recaptcha is a wonderful service that stops spam like mollom of Dries Butt . If you have a mail id , then you may know what spam is . Gmail may be the best mail service which can protect spam . Now adays every mail service do like that . But gmail seems to be much better than any .  If you have a website with a contact form , you can notice that it will be the most visited page . As a webdeveloper we should use a captcha service to block spam . Else our domain will be listed in the domain which generates spam . Recaptcha is a free service that can protect your forms from spam . There are many plugins or modules for wordpress , drupal etc .

Thanks to mollom too . I love mollom because it will not show the captcha unless it thinks its spam . There may be many other wonderful services like Mollom and recaptcha . You can use it, according to your taste .

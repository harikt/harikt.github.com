Hello my dear friends ,  I was using GNU/Linux for some 3-4 years now . The one of the browser which comes with every distribution of GNU/Linux is Firefox . Its a wonderful opensource browser available for every Operating Systems . The firefox has a collection of Addons, which makes it much powerful than any other browser .  [![Spread Firefox Affiliate Button](http://images.spreadfirefox.com/affiliates/Buttons/firefox3/foxkeh-fx3-300x250.png)](http://www.mozilla.com/?from=sfx&uid=267461&t=322)  I think I was little late to join the community spread firefox . But today I joined the community to spread the fire of the Fox . I have recommended many of my friends for using the nice browser. Once you use you will never go for any other browser . The community is powerful, this may be one of the greatest advantage of firefox . Go and try if you have not downloaded one .

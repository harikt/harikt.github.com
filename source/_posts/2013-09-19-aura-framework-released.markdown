It is a great feeling, and one of the happiest moment in my life when 
[aura releases its stable framework](http://auraphp.com/blog/2013/09/18/aura-framework-stable-system-release/).

Aura is one of my first framework, which helped me to learn the inner 
working of a framework, how to create a framework, rather than playing 
with full stack framework.

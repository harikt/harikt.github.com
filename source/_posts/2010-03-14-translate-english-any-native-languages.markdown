Oh no just considering India ( my country ) itself there are lots of languages ( More than the number of states itself ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) ) . I don't know every language too . Google has recently came with a desktop application which currently translate from 14 different languages - Arabic, Bengali, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.  Some of the fatures are  1 ) Offline Support : You don't need an internet connection.  2 ) Word Completions : Dictionary based word completions for prefixes.  3 ) Personalized Choices : Remember user corrections for personalized service.  4 ) Easy Keyboard : Dictionary enabled keyboard to enter rare and complex words.  5 ) Quick Search : Single click web search for highlighted word.  6 ) Cool Customization : Customize suggestions page size, display font and more.  The thing is its only available for windows ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif) . So I have not tried the application , but you guys can have a try .

In this tutorial I am showing how to install aura cli project v2 
via composer.

[Aura.Cli_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli_Project) help 
you to build cli ( command line ) applications.

If you need only web based application then 
[Aura.Web_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web_Project) 
is what you need.

If you need web and cli, then 
[Aura.Framework_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework_Project).

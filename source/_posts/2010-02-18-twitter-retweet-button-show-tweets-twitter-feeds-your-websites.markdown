I know I have missed to post lots of nice applications. You may be aware or may not be . Anyway this is really interesting one to every one. I hope every one is using twitter or you may have atleast heard about twitter . I am really addicted to twitter the micro blogging client . Twitter may be one reason that makes me lasy to post long description blog posts .  These are some of the things that twitter misses , or we all love to see in twitter .  1 ) Updating the tweets quickly : Now we need to refresh the page manually or you may be using a twitter client like choqok or tweetdeck or some other. We can use one jquery based twitter client which can be used in websites to show the recent tweets from you or your favourite terms . Yes juitter a javascript tool will do the work . You just need to download the scripts and do the necessary things .  Eg :  Download the script from http://www.juitter.com/  <code\>  <script language="javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.3.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"\></script\> <script language="javascript" src="/js/jquery.juitter.js" type="text/javascript"\></script\> <script language="javascript" src="/js/system.js" type="text/javascript"\></script\>  </code\>  The system.js files contains the configuration . Not much just a few lines  <code\>  $(document).ready(function() {     $.Juitter.start({         searchType:"fromUser",         searchObject:"harikt",         lang:"en",         live:"live-15",         placeHolder:"juitterContainer",         loadMSG: "Loading messages...",         imgName: "loader.gif",         total: 20,         readMore: "Read it on Twitter",         nameUser:"image"     }); );  </code\>  The place holder is where the tweets will be showing . ie <div id="juitterContainer"\></div\> now shows the twitter feeds which you have given as the search term .  I noticed this wonderful tool after following the lithium php framework . Have already written about the new born rapidly growing framework . You can [read about lithium over here](http://harikt.com/node/120) . You can go and look the demo at http://www.juitter.com/ .  2 ) Retweet button : Every site owner will be trying to increase the amount of visitors to their website . Twitter brings some visitors to your website too. So why not keeping a retweet button . Yes John Resig ( the author of jquery , employee at Mozilla and much more ....) has developed a retweet button . Its easier than the tweetme button . Will be send directly to twitter website . You can see the sample and use the code located at http://ejohn.org/blog/retweet/  These two applications uses jquery . If you are interested to learn jquery, Packt has a wonderful book "Learn jquery 1.3" , also John Resig have written some books . You can consider buying one and enjoying working with jquery to build your next website UI .

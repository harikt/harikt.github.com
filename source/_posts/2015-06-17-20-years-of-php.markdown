First my apologies being late! I hope you all know PHP is celebrating its
20th years of existence in the web.

There is something that makes PHP unique that helps to standout with
other languages.

In this opporchunity I would like to thank the creator, the contributors,
the maintainers, and all the users (past/present) to make this
memorable.

## My Story

I got an exposure to learn and use internet in my college days.
In those period I look html as a very complex language.
I wasnâ€™t aware there exists editors which help you.

Around 2006, iirc Ganesh sir was the one who introduced me to PHP, and then with
the guidance and help of Jose Antony.

College life ended in 2007. The search begins to find a job, and I managed to get one.

In 2009, I wrote a blog post [A simple Blog using Zend framework 1.9](http://phpdeveloper.org/news/13242) which got lots of attraction.

I wasn't aware [phpdeveloper.org](http://phpdeveloper.org/) and [devzone.zend.com](http://devzone.zend.com/) was changing my life and getting more closer to the people in the PHP community.

Some [people praised, some disagreed](https://web.archive.org/web/20120118060053/http://devzone.zend.com/1554/a-simple-blog-with-zend-framework-19/#comment-1039) which I came across a tool called [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/).

In 2010, I attended my first conference osidays and met some of the awesome
people like David Coallier, Fabien Potencier, Jacob Vrana, Dave Hall and many more.

## Into the world of open-source

I would like to thank [Paul M Jones](http://paul-m-jones.com) the man behind [auraphp.com](http://auraphp.com) for all the help, support and mentoring.

Started with stupid questions, and slowly as a small contributor.

Contributing to open-source gave me some confidence and it opened some help
from the community.

Thank you [Beau D Simensen](https://beau.io/), [CalEvans](http://blog.calevans.com/).

Start a habit of learning, you will not regret joining [NomadPHP](http://nomadphp.com) it is awesome!.

Thank you all, and thanks for all the help and support you guys are showing.

Happy PhPing!

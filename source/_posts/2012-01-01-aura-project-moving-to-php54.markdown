What's Aura project ? :  For those who are new to Aura , [Aura project](http://auraphp.github.com) was a component based library planned for 5.3+, which is a major rewrite of [Solar framework for PHP](http://solarphp.com).

So today in the eve of New Year, Paul M Jones the lead developer for Aura Project for PHP officially announced Aura will be targetting for PHP 5.4 + and not for 5.3.  The benefits are  - short array syntax  - the "callable" typehint  - apply traits if needed  Join the [Aura Project for PHP google group.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/auraphp) or \#auraphp channel at irc.freenode.net .  Now you have a reason to Play with PHP 5.4 and also test the RC4 and file bugs before it becomes stable.

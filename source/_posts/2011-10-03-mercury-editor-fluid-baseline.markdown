Mercury Editor : So going through the Symfony CMF post on [Liip Blog](http://liip.ch) I came accross a nice editor Mercury. Mercury is a full featured HTML5 editor like Aloha Editor . You can download or see it in action over : http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/ I am impressed on the first look, awesome :) . Fluid Baseline : Another project I was impressed is the [Fluid Baseline grid](http://fluidbaselinegrid.com/) . It may be good that you go and look in browser with different sizes. Some properties are Fluid Columns, Baseline Grid, Responsive Design. Go and see dude :) . Impressive .

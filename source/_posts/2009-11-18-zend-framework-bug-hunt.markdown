[![Zend framework bug hunt](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2626/4113996969_57204af27d_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113996969/)I was reading the post ( http://devzone.zend.com/article/11326-Announcing-Novembers-ZF-Bug-Hunting-Days ) about Zend framework bug hunt by Mathew from devzone . The bug hunt is on Thursday and Friday, 19-20 November 2009 every one can join .  I was not previously logging to \#zftalk or \#zftalk.dev irc channels . But seeing the post by [Padraic](http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/423-A-Guide-To-Zend-Framework-Bug-Hunt-Days.html) I was interested to look into it . I added the chatzilla addon of mozilla firefox and logged in to the irc channels .  Yes it was my first experince in an irc ( though I have been hearing about irc for a long time ) . I am not a master in Zend framework , but I would love to sign a CLA ( Contributor License Agreement ) , for the points that Padraic points out . If I have not read about the post I may not have thought of signing a CLA too .  If you are using Zend framework , then you too can help to grow the zend framework . Please do read the post by Padraic .  Thanks once again to all . ( Image credits to Google ( labeled to reuse from http://frank.itlab.us ) )

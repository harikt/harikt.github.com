[![Zendframework 2 logo by zend technologies](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4703475643_c68bbc34ce.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4703475643/)  Picture courtsey to [zend technologies](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zend-Technologies/190917412139) . When I started learning a MVC framework like Zend ( version 1.8 ) with out any prior knowledge in an MVC architectured framework , it was hard for me to figure out many of the things documented in framework.zend.com . I spend lot of time to figure out what they have shown in the examples to [develop a simple application which I later published to help people](http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19) learning zend framework ( Though it was not developed thinking in my mind to publish, I hope it helped some ) . But looking today the zend framework documentation has lots of improvements, may be because I learned something looking other frameworks too. I was interested to see much of the things what symfony does in the command line ( for I love my GNU/Linux terminal and love to work on it ). But after sometime I came to know many of the things that symfony does is with doctrine ORM ( There are lots of other commands too for symfony ) . Doctrine2 will be integrating with zend framework version 2 onwards .  Sometimes IÂ have even blamed zend framework , for I was angry unable to do what I needed spending hours of searching . But I am sorry for that zend. You may ask me why you didn't get into irc or mailing list and ask your doubts . Ya I entered to irc for the first time when I started learning \#zf , but its hard to get a quick reply. I saw many people asking questions , but many were not answered . I know the reasons for they will be working on their on projects and getting a quick reply was hard.  Ok let's move on to my topic, I am planning to learn/ sharpen my knowledge in [Zend framework](http://framework.zend.com/) . I would you to suggest me some topics , that you love to see implemented with zend framework in my spare time. I will be trying to use [Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/). I would love to develop it with TDD using [phpunit](http://www.phpunit.de) ( Every thing is new just having some knowledge which is harmful ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) ). If you have anything in your mind let me know .  Thanks for reading my unwanted thoughts .

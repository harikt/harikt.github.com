After a long wait I too got my google wave . My friend [Arun Basilal](https://twitter.com/ArunBasilLal) got wave .

I was waiting and waiting and google may have tested my patience . And finally today ( November 2nd ) I was telling [Priyan](http://twitter.com/priyanr) to send me one more , as wave didn't reach after 48 hours .  Priyan was Happy and send me an invite . Opening gmail IÂ was really Happy to see the the google invite from Arun Basilal of [Million Clues](http://www.millionclues.com) . Thanks once again Priyan and Basilal .

I want to make experiments with it. Thanks to all and Thanks to google for making a wonderful application .  Still wondering what wave is ? Oh then the video is for you . Get inspired and rock on wave . Google wave at present needs invitation .  Hope this video made you crazy .  Updated on 07 November 2009 : After some days of using google wave I feel that google wave will not rock until every user gets one . Many are inactive for you may be having only a few people in your contacts who uses wave . So they just check wave once a day . Its a great colloborative tool, and I know that it will rocks in the future. So you guys may want to wait until you get an invite . Its always good that developers get wave invite rather than just users ;) .  11 th November 2009 : I have a very few google wave invites. If anyone is interested in it , just drop a comment . I will send it to you , if its not over . Just 8 invites are there ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . So the first 8 will get it .

We the ISPG ' ians ( Internet sales Promotion Group , a web development firm with main office at cochin ) celebrated Onam on 29th August 2009 . As the CEO Mr K G Sajith sir and some of the collegues ( especaily Sooraj sir who will be always the core player of any occation ) was at Bangalore and they were unable to attend the function . It was a really colourful event . We have missed the previous Onam as many were sick with Chicken pox.  Anoop sir was the Maveli of this year . He was looking great with the dress . Keeping one of the picture of him with some of the ISPG ians .

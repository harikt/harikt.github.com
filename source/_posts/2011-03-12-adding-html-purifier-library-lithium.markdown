Hope everyone knows about [HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/) and why its used. Martin Brampton's new book [PHP 5 CMS Framework Development](https://www.packtpub.com/php-5-cms-framework-development-second-edition/book) includes a discussion of using HTML Purifier in your content managementsystem.  Today I thought of adding HTMLPurifier to Lithium . Its easy but sometimes we may want to look the autoloader and how its implemented. So this is a small contribution from me.  There is also another way. ie go and clone https://github.com/harikt/li3\_htmlpurifier. Download all the files to HTMLPurifier . And add Libraries::add('li3\_htmlpurifier');  Hope you liked :-) . Have fun .

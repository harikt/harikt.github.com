What do you think, Is it really worth to go to a conference, 
and spend so much money?

Yes, it is really worth. You don't know what will happen tomorrow. 

These are some of the things that you can take from a conference

* Mingle with people and get new contacts

* Learn from the mistakes they did

* Not re-inveting the wheels others already did

* Who knows whether you are getting new job opportunities ;-).

* Improve your work from the experience you learned.

I would like to give a shout at what I learned/earned going to conferences

* I got different job opportuntities and many new friends.

* I was able to meet different prominent persons of the PHP community
like [Fabien Potencier](https://github.com/fabpot), [Jakub Vr√°na](https://github.com/vrana), 
[David Coallier](https://github.com/davidcoallier), [Dave Hall](https://github.com/skwashd),
[Bastian Feder](https://github.com/lapistano), [Alessandro Nadalin](https://github.com/odino)
 and many more.

Some of the conferences I attended are osidays 2010(as an attendee) and 
2012 (as a speaker), yahoo open hack 2012, hasgeek events.
[Hasgeek](https://hasgeek.com/) events are one of the best events. 
One of the best conference I atteneded by Hasgeek 
is [Fifth elephant](https://fifthelephant.in/2012/).
It is well organized and have strict timing. I got more interested in 
data mining, analysis, processing etc. 
Also got introduced to Hadoop and much more.

I wasn't aware were I will be using stuffs like [gearman](http://gearman.org/), 
[nltk](http://nltk.org/), [Elastic Search](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), 
[GrayLog2](http://graylog2.org/), [Log Stash](http://www.logstash.net/) etc. 
Fifth elephant and Yahoo open hack really helped me a lot to learn more about 
what the people at the conference is working on, what are the challenges 
they are facing, how they resolved etc.

If you are like me, who love to attend conference, but 
unable to move to the location where it is happening, 
then [NomandPHP](http://nomadphp.com/) is looking at you. 
One of the good feature is you can watch the videos later, 
if you are unable to attend at the time.
Please Thank [Cal Evans](https://twitter.com/CalEvans) for 
the greatest initiative.

You can also join mastering object oriented programming with the 
[Object Oriented PHP Masterclass](http://objectorientedphpmasterclass.com/)
by [Brandon Savage](http://www.brandonsavage.net)

There is also a great initiative by 
[Noufal Ibrahim](https://twitter.com/noufalibrahim) called 
[The Lycaeum](http://thelycaeum.in/).

So do attend a conference, and don't miss opportunities that are 
looking at you tomorrow.

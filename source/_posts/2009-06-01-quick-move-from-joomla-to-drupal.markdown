Some of you may have noticed a change in user interface . Yes I have changed my CMS from Joomla to Drupal. I don't want to miss many of the indexed search results of google and any other search engines . So it takes some time to make this site fully functional. I just removed my old site . Keeping a screen shot of it below .  ![harikt.com in joomla once](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3594102745_681ca97b86.jpg?v=0)  I have ~~missed~~to add some of the ads here. Also the google custom search. Also I ~~need to implement~~ the fluid width to the new theme like the one of rs\_milky. See you soon in a great new look ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) Cheers .  Yes, now I have changed some of the styles. Not getting much time to spend on my site. In the future you can see some more changes.

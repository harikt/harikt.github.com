It took sometime for me to create a series of screencast on 
[aura](http://auraphp.com). So my plan to start a series of 
screencasts starts with [Aura.Router](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router)
version 2.

Yes, I have made some mistakes, but I do love to hear your feedback 
and interest for the future screencast.

The next one will be on [Dispatcher](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Dispatcher)
If you want to cover something special in the 
[Dispatcher](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Dispatcher) I will try to 
address it.

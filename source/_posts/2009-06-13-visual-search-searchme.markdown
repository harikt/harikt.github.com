By coolris we can use the preview of a website when we search in google. I have tried it and it was a wonderful tool. Recently I found another search engine which uses the same features. But its having something different.  In coolris , when we point to the preview the page will be loaded in small box. May be in an iframe ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif).  But in searchme each page is loaded with the image of the site. We can move to the next by just moving the mouse to right . Its in beeta version . Looks pretty good .  You can have a look into the site [searchme.com](http://searchme.com)

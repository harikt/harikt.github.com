Google will be coming with the new application wave in this year . Its a collobration of social networks with email etc .  Its somthing similar to twitter . Its a threaded application like a forum ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . For more information about waves you can see [http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html) which will be better than what I write .

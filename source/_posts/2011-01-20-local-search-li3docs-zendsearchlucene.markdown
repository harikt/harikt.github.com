Oh I am lazy for not posting my second cup of lithium over here . But you can check something over [http://dev.lithify.me/forks/harikt/lithium\_blog/wiki/home](http://dev.lithify.me/forks/harikt/lithium_blog/wiki/home) . So you know I am a fan boy of Lithium. I used to hang on \#li3 irc just for fun, though I am not developing anything serious with lithium for now .  We used to read the documentation with the help of li3\_docs plugin. Its so cool. But searching locally was not possible. If you have internet connection then it may not be a trouble too :) . Questions come and go, sometimes we may be knowing where we read it, but don't remember the exact controller action or the property. Oh my :-)  So I finally decided to hack on li3\_docs plugin to make a search locally with the help of the Zend\_Search\_Lucene 's power . You can read more about [Zend Lucene component over here](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.overview.html). This is also a good point to show you that anything can be integrated with li3 ;). So no more blha blha blha . Just codes coming on the way .  First you need to create the index pointing to /searches/makeindex . Before doing that change the url according to yours. For now I assume http://lithium.local/docs/ which is the only part I have hard coded. Nate has agreed to look into it and make the necessary changes and we will try to make it as plugin if he loves :-). So the files are below. I hope know something about li3, li3\_docs etc. This uses the extractor from li3\_docs :-)  You can see how I have included the Zend library as from [http://dev.lithify.me/lithium/wiki/guides/using/zend](http://dev.lithify.me/lithium/wiki/guides/using/zend)  Do create an empty file makeindex.html.php in the searches folder of view before creating index.  Now do your way, may be add a form and point to the controller and action or what ever you love. As always licensed under the same licene of [http://lithify.me/](http://lithify.me/) . Hang on to \#li3 on irc.freenode.net to ask anything more on it :-) .  Note : Set time limit to 0 . ieÂ  set\_time\_limit( 0 ); in bootstrap.php for creating the index. The methods are called recursively and needs sometime to create the index . Once indexed you don't want , just query through it .

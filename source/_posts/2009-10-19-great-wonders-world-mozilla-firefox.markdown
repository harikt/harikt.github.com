I hope every one know about mozilla firefox ( Popular open-source web browser ) . If you are a webdeveloper you may defnitely know about [firebug](http://www.harikt.com/tools-for-webdevelopers/42-firebug-a-handy-tool-for-web-developers) which is a handy tool . But today I would like to introduce some of the wonderful tools in the mozilla labs . Some of you may have already tried and know how powerful it is .  **Ubiquity** :  [![ubiquity](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4026231282_ca08c5b0ef_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026231282/)This is a wonderful tool and every one will love the great features . We can call this as a command line tool for Mozilla firefox. Don't think its so hard , its the one of the best tool which will help . Just a ctrl + space will start the ubiquity command. You can insert maps , contents , translate , bookmark to delicious , search , calculate etc .  Some of you guys may know me , I love command line and this tool is a great one which is changing the mozilla . It may be sometimes part of firefox after its released from labs . You can close tabs of particular url , title etc . Open the closed urls and many more . You just need to install ubiquity addon . Check out the page http://labs.mozilla.com/ubiquity/ if you are interested to see it in action .  Check out the video and get inspired  If you are in GNU/Linux , then the short cut key conflicts , so you can change the ubiquity short cut key by going to the setting tab from about:ubiquity and chaging to your desired one . I am using ctrl + space for now , and its so easy to change to your easy remembering short cuts.  **Personnas :**  Many of them may have already tried Personas . ( For thos who don't know it ). Every one love to see their browsers in a variety of style . Then personnas is for you .  [![Personas](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2604/4026228810_c4f01afda4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026228810/)  Its a light weight plugin for firefox to change the style of firefox. Check it out from http://labs.mozilla.com/personas/  **Prism :**  Again if you are a GNU/Linux user you may have already tried Prism ( If you have tried to get an alternative for gtalk ) . It can work as a stand alone application for the desktop . A google talk desktop application uses prism.  [![Prism](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2498/4025476843_074999a00b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025476843/)  Check it out from http://labs.mozilla.com/prism/  **Snowl :**  Snowl is a wonderful tool if you are a blog reader , if you are participating in online discussions etc . I am sure that you love snowl if you love to read feeds, which is something like google reader .  [![Snowl](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2674/4026232656_fec61827f6.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026232656/)  You can get more information from http://labs.mozilla.com/snowl/  **Weave :**  So you need encryption before sending data, to make your data more secure . Yes weave does encryption in client side and transfer data . It uses cryptographic engine for encryption . You can store all your personal data in a weave server secure. You need to have a weave account for it. 3 party integartion is possible with weave .  [![Weave](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4026232002_42baf625fd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4026232002/)  More information about the addon can be found in http://labs.mozilla.com/weave/  **Test Pilot** :  Testing is always an important factor in software development . The cost of testing will be more than the actual development of software . So if you love to give a feed back to the mozilla firefox, they can make the product much more better and can make the product the way you are looking . So its your time to get involved and participate with testing and make the user experience better and better .  [![test pilot](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2578/4025478051_90fe1c5b50.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025478051/)  More information can be obtained from http://labs.mozilla.com/testpilot/  **Bespin** :  Bespin is called as code in the cloud . Its an open extensible web-based framework for code editing that aims to increase developer productivity, enable compelling user experiences, and promote the use of open standards.  [![Bespin](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/4025474181_5ea72c773c.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025474181/)  More information about bespin can be found in http://labs.mozilla.com/bespin/  **JetPack**:  Jetpack is an API to develop great firefox addons with the web technologies you currently know . Its an opensource project and has just started .  [![Jetpack](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2792/4025475065_0cf49e3ebd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4025475065/)  Join the project if you are interested to contribute to Jetpack on http://labs.mozilla.com/jetpack/  **Concept-series** :  You may not be a coder , but you may be having some great ideas which can change the whole web .

Before going to speak at osidays, the first thing I did was read the book Paid to Speak. It gave me lots of insights how I can improve. The book was given to me by Jennifer Kumar. I have shared my thoughts on her blog. You can read more from [9 Lessons on Being a Public Speaker](http://www.authenticjourneys.info/2012/12/9-lessons-on-being-public-speaker.html)

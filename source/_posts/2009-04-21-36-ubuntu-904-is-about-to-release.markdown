[![Ubuntu: For Desktops, Servers, Netbooks and in the cloud](http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/static.png "Ubuntu: For Desktops, Servers, Netbooks and in the cloud")](http://www.ubuntu.com "Get Ubuntu")Canonical is releasing the new Ubuntu version 9.04 called Jaunty. Now you can download it for testing purpose. I still remember how I installed the Ubuntu 4.10 when I got from Akhil one of my friend who was studying at NIT. He was the person who introduces Ubuntu before me . I was using the Mandrake , rehat etc at the time . He told should be careful installing it. It was not having a good graphics at that time. But now the Ubuntu community has grown . You can see how it has made the great presence in Desktop , Laptop , Servers .  After every six months the Ubuntu will be introducing the newer versions . Do you know how the version numbering is done for ubuntu ? Its nothing but , just the year first and then the numeric digit of month . So this is 2009 April and it releases 9.04 . The earlier version was 8.10 which was released on 2008 October . So the last numbers will be always 04 and 09 . I hope there will be no change for this ![Cool](plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif "Cool") . The newer versions contains different security fixes and new software .  ![Ubuntu Desktop in a glance](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3322/3491661248_7d36df796e.jpg?v=0 "Ubuntu Desktop in a glance") ![Ubuntu Help](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3627/3490846393_a39d5d1353.jpg?v=0 "Ubuntu Help") ![Different Languages that Ubuntu supports](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/3491663748_08468e9dd3.jpg?v=0 "Different Languages that Ubuntu supports") Ubuntu is a debain based GUN/Linux operating system . Its pretty simple to use . There is a wide range of choice for many softwares totally free . If your hard disk have failed , now its not a big deal. You can still use the system . No need of hard disk. Just login with your ubuntu live CD and just save in your thumb or email if you have internet connection . The internet has grown and you can explore it for your needs . Upload your favourite pictures to picasa or flicker, documents to google docs , slide share etc . It will not be this much simple with out the presence of Internet. The world wide web has played a great role in establishing these things .  What Ubuntu promises is  -   Ubuntu will always be free of charge, including enterprise     releases and security updates. -   Ubuntu comes with full commercial support from Canonical and     hundreds of companies around the world. -   Ubuntu includes the very best translations and accessibility     infrastructure that the free software community has to offer. -   Ubuntu CDs contain only free software applications; we     encourage you to use free and open source software, improve it and     pass it on.  You can get your free copy of Ubuntu from Canonical through shipping. The free disc of Ubuntu may be one of the reason for the greatest popularity of Ubuntu . I was having a dial up connection at that time. So it will be always difficult for every one to get a copy. The free disc have helped me a lot. I hope not only to me , but to many . There is a huge change for Ubuntu from the previous versions . It will detect almost all your hardwares . Its pretty simple to configure with synaptic package manager . There is inbuilt driver for the EVDO . I am using a BSNL EVDO connection. I have configured the EVDO to work in ubuntu . You can use the wvdial command for configuring it and dialling.  This is what you need to do .  Connect the device when the system boots , in the panel you can see the Broad Com driver ready . Activate it . You may need to download the wvdial using synaptic package manager . The below are the commands used to configure from terminal . ( Applications-\>Terminal )  $ sudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf  The above command will find the device and write the configuration to /etc/wvdial.conf . You can see from output whether it finds the device , if so you need to edit the wvdial.conf  $ sudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf  I uses vim for editing . But you may not be familiar so you can use the text editor . Remove the \# symbol and save your username , password etc given by BSNL authority . Something like the below  [Dialer Defaults] Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0 Modem Type = Analog Modem Baud = 9600 New PPPD = yes Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 ISDN = 0 Stupid Mode = 1 Phone = \#777 Username = username Password = password Now you can dial using wvdial .It will hang up never close till you have finished browsing the web with your favourite browser .( Mozilla for many guys ![Smile](plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif "Smile") ). When successfully connected you can see IP address of the form 10.0.01.12 ( some thing like this --\> local IP address 10.2.40.227 --\> pppd: Ч� ��� --\> remote IP address 192.168.52.12 --\> pppd: Ч� ��� --\> primary DNS address 218.248.240.180 --\> pppd: Ч� ��� --\> secondary DNS address 218.248.240.181 --\> pppd: Ч� ���  $ sudo wvdial  After you finished browing can use Ctrl + c to terminate .  Note : Firefox often complains about the error like below  Offline Mode Firefox is currently in offline mode and can't browse the Web. The browser is operating in its offline mode and cannot connect to the requested item. \* Is the computer connected to an active network? \* Place the browser in online mode and try again.  If there is trouble viewing look whether Work Offline is unticked File-\>Work Offline from Mozilla .  You will also have trouble connecting the empathy to chat with your friends .It will not connect even right password .Empathy will be always in offline mode even if you change to online . If empathy not changing to online mode just untick the enable networking .  You can rectify the problem by right clicking on the network and disable enable networking by unticking it .  I have recommended many friends to use Ubuntu and many from college itself had ordered and have tried it . If its releasing on 23 April , then I am really Happy bcoz I am celebrating my 24^th^ B'day ![Smile](plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif "Smile").  The canonical is the one which supports the ubuntu project and its community . There are lots of courses they are teaching . You can help canonical and support the ubuntu by various means .

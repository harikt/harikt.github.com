I have been looking the traffic rank of my website in alexa . But before the blog post about the [blog tutorial using zend framework](http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19) , it was far away ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . You cannot think the number .  But now I am happy as I am below 10 lakhs . I don't really know how its working , because we are not placing any javascript or anything in our site for alexa to crawl. If its google then I can say its with the google webmaster tools .  I am very happy to see even though harikt.com is not in the hundreds or thousands . I wonder how much bandwidth is consumed for the sites in the top list . Even my site consumes a huge bandwidth .

Twitter is fun, sometimes we may go like a chat , sometimes we may be getting a reply after some days . So what about showing the whole status from start to last ? I build an experimental project today just for fun.  Try it over [http://harikt.com/twitter.php](http://harikt.com/twitter.php)  Fork me at Â [https://github.com/harikt/TweetRelation](https://github.com/harikt/TweetRelation)

I downloaded the Google chromium OS from google . I was having some trouble configuring my Ubuntu 9.04 with virtualbox ( Not the bug of virtual box or Ubuntu , it was my fault ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif) ). Downloaded Karmic Kola ( Ubuntu 9.10 ) and installed from USB . You can see my [previous post how to create USB from image](http://harikt.com/gnu-linux-and-open-source/43-booting-gnewsense-gnulinux-from-usb) . The newer versions of Ubuntu rocks . Anyone needs it , just get in touch with me .  Now I downloaded the google chromium virtual box image from techcrunch ( I thought not to reinvent the google chromium virtual box image ) . If you want to try chromium you can go and get the image from [techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/guide-install-google-chrome-os/) and the post demonstrates each and every step very clearly .

You may not be able to login to Chromium if you are not connected to Internet . I have not read the future plans of the chromium OS . But I have some suggestions .  1 ) Chromium may need a facility to go offline too .  I hope my first point is very clear . We must be able to login to chromium when there is no internet connection too .  2 ) Office , a one like open-office ( a tool similar to microsoft office, not properitery but free and opensource ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) )  Google is using google docs which is also an online tool . We may need a facility to use google docs even we are offline . ie saving somthing in an xml format or what ever the good format is in our hard disk and synchronising after we go online .  3 ) Todo list  I was very Happy to see the todo list . But it seems its only available for the google team . Its not for us ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad_smile.gif) . But it may be good if we ( chromium users ) too get a todo list from google . Although google calendar is there .  And everything that you see in the google chromium list are online tools . So we need offline facility too . Hope google chrome OS will come with it , also  gtalk ( with voice support ) .  If I have missed any let me know .

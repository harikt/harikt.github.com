First of all Happy Independence day . As India is celebrating its Independence I thought of writing a post about Drupal theme that I love . This is my personal opinion . So you can explore the drupal themes section for your selection . After learning more and more about drupal , I started updating this . So I may want to say these are not the 6 , but the different themes that I love . Recently I fall in love with fusion .   **Genesis** : The reason I love it are Flexible layout  : Every design is having a similar layout. I don't think there is not much different layouts . The layout seems to be same . The things that changes are color, images and contents ( lol ).  ![Genesis drupal theme](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3549/3823907806_cd0487d679.jpg)  You may never agree with me that this is a good design if and only if you know how to change the style of this theme , like adding some nice graphics etc .  **Zen** : The next wonderful theme that I love is zen for as I described above .  ![Zen drupal theme](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2675/3823926530_3bc27ee92f.jpg)  **Acquia Marina** : If you are looking the design with out much changes , then this theme Acquia Marina is the one I love . I have made some changes to make it work as a flexible one rather than sticking on to a particular width . I hope IE users also don't have much problem as I am only using GNU/Linux. And I can gaurantee one thing that Mozilla users will not be having any issues .  ![Acquia drupal theme](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3823909300_b7ecbd195b.jpg)  **Waffles** : Another flexible theme by the same providers of Acquia Marina .  ![Waffle drupal theme](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2486/3823910446_072aed37e5.jpg)  **Black Mamba** : Flexible 1, 2, 3 columns like the waffles . May be having some changes to color only .  ![Black Mamba](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3823911616_402d0a27d8.jpg)  **960 Robots** : From lullabot . Yes they have a video tutorial for building your own themes fr Drupal . They explains the developement of themes from scratch using this theme . The preview is available in youtube . I think buying one will not be a loss of money for any one who is new to Drupal . You can see the podcasts and blog and really will feel it.  ![Nine sixty Robot drupal theme](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3426/3823911904_00e7b5557e.jpg)     **Fusion** from Top notch themes :  [Fusion Core Demo](http://vimeo.com/7670241) from [Jeremy Caldwell](http://vimeo.com/eternalistic) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).  More over every themes are free in the website http://drupal.org/project/Themes . So feel free to explore and try it out .

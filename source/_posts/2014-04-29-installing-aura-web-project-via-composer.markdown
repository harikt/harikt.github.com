In this tutorial I am showing how to install aura web project v2 
via composer.

    composer create-project -s beta aura/web-project path-to-project

[Aura.Web_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Web_Project) helps 
you to build web based application. If you need web and cli then 
[Aura.Framework_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework_Project) 
is what you need.

If you need only cli, then [Aura.Cli_Project](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Cli_Project) helps you.

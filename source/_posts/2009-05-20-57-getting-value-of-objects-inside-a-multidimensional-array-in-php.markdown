This is some what interesting post to many of you . I have tried some time to make this correct for one of my friend Jaisenan . I like debugging, so spend some time to make this working. We was looking to get the value in a multidimensional array . One of the value in the array was an object. And this was the big problem , and was looking to solve it . Here is the array  $x = Array ( [\#theme] =\> content\_multiple\_values [\#title] =\> Face to Face Time [\#required] =\> 0 [\#description] =\> [0] =\> Array ( [\#type] =\> duration\_combo [\#default\_value] =\> Duration Object ( [duration] =\> Array ( [years] =\> 0 [months] =\> 0 [days] =\> 0 [hours] =\> 0 [minutes] =\> 0 [seconds] =\> 0 )  [is\_negative] =\> [is\_valid] =\> 1 [conversion\_factors] =\> Array ( [seconds/minutes] =\> 60 [minutes/hours] =\> 60 [hours/days] =\> 24 [days/weeks] =\> 7 [days/months] =\> 30 [weeks/years] =\> 52.142857142857 [months/years] =\> 12 )  )  [\#largest\_metric] =\> hours [\#smallest\_metric] =\> minutes [\#element\_validate] =\> Array ( [0] =\> duration\_combo\_validate )  [\#title] =\> Face to Face Time [\#description] =\> [\#required] =\> [\#weight] =\> 0 [\#delta] =\> 0 [\#columns] =\> Array ( [0] =\> iso8601 [1] =\> approx\_seconds )  [\#field\_name] =\> field\_pn\_ff\_time\_1 [\#type\_name] =\> progress\_note )  [\#field\_name] =\> field\_pn\_ff\_time\_1 [\#tree] =\> 1 [\#weight] =\> 4 [\#access] =\> 1 [\#count] =\> 5 )  Let the array name be x . Now let me walk through this associative array in PHP . $x['\#theme'] , $x['\#title'] etc . Now we where looking to get the value of hours , minutes etc of the array duration . The '\#default\_value' was a Duration object .  So here comes the solution for you .  **$x[0]['\#default\_value']-\>duration['hours']** . You can assign values or get values of this array . I spend some hours to make this small code work. So thought of publishing this for some one who is in search for an example like this . This was a small debugging from Drupal .   $x['\#tree'] , $x['0']['\#type'] are some other example to retrieve value from this multidimensional array . The example above is used to get the value from the object . Cheers guys and Have a great day .

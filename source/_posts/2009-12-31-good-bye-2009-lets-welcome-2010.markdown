Hi guys, first of all I wish you and your family a Happy and Prosperous Newyear .  [![Happy\_New\_Year\_2010](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2607/4231563110_37045dfe0d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4231563110/ "Happy_New_Year_2010 by K T Hari, on Flickr")  I cannot say 2009 was a bad year for me . I gained a lot of things in 2009 . But I am looking even more in 2010. Lets celebrate this Newyear 2010 with some of the friends I am using and learning ( This is not a full stop , but just a start ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif) ) . You may be familiar with much of the logos . Anyway let me introduce to those who are not familiar with these .  Zend framework : Which makes my blog so popular . Thanks to Zend's devzone , google to make my website in the search list and all my visitors  and well wishers.  jQuery and Prototype : Recognised the powerful javascript framework. But I was forced to move with prototype .  Drupal : I recognised the power of Drupal as I started using it . Its really a wonderful framework . But the sad thing is I didnot get any chance to work on any drupal projects.  Many of you may be familiar with the logo of windows . So I may not need to introduce Microsoft Windows. Never think I hate windows, this was a picture I got from [http://www.new-dream.de/](http://www.new-dream.de/) . The other ones on the left and right of burning windows is GNU/Linux and free bsd.  If you are not a techie , you may not be familiar with the tag <?php ![image](http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) . Its nothing other than a powerful webscripting language php, on which I used to work daily . Every logos are copyright to their respective owners . I don't have any copyright on any of these.

Testing is really pain . How do you figure that all the code you write is fully functional ? For eg : 5 divided by 0 will give you a Math error . So you may need to test our codes . Phpunit is a tool to test your codes . Recently I was trying to learn to write test cases as I started learning Zend framework . There are many automated testing tools like phpunit . You can explore it if needed .  Another one is the phpundercontrol ( I was hearing about this in many blogs and php magazines )Â  . It can be installed with phpunit . Its also a great tool to see the graphical representation of the php performance . I have not looked much, so do visit the sites and get more informations about it .  http://www.phpunit.de  http://phpundercontrol.org  http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/

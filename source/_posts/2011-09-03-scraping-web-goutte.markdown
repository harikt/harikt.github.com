Some months back I read the article [php|architect's guide to Web Scraping with PHP - Don't let the title fool you](http://devzone.zend.com/article/12584). It was a review for the [book](http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-guide-to-web-scraping-with-php/) of Mathew Turland ( [@elazar](http://twitter.com/elazar) ) by Cal Evans . But I didnot read the book too . Days passes I saw [Goutte](https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte) a simple web scrapper by @fabpot (  [Fabien Potentier](http://fabien.potencier.org) ) .  But two days back I was looking how I can download my friends contact details from facebook. I didnot find a means to get the mobile numbers or email address. I looked the API , but it didnot provide some functionalities like that . Then what to do ?  If I have got the email and phone number I can sync with my gmail and via it to my android handset . But I didnot find anything , may be other softwares will be there . But I simply thought of learning scraping than going to do something .  Goutte is a simple library which can be downloaded as a phar file also. So you just want to add a require for the phar file . It utilises some of the symfony components and zend http component . You can login , select links , clicks on it , filter the content , fetch data etc.  I was able to make the script going through some of the articles below .  Read me of https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte  http://www.phparch.com/2010/04/four-new-php-5-3-components-and-goutte-a-simple-web-scraper/  http://fabien.potencier.org/article/42/parsing-xml-documents-with-css-selectors  Also the api :) . Its really a powerful php scraping tool. Yes its easy if you know how the css selectors work .  Download Goutte over https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte or using wget https://raw.github.com/fabpot/Goutte/master/goutte.phar . Start scraping :) .

I was hearing about Bhuvan recently . I was little busy , but after receiving a mail with subject "Bhuvan: ISRO's answer to google earth" I thought of looking the site .  This is the address . http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/ . I saw new news Bhuvan is available in Mozilla firefox and netscape .  Bhuvan is only for the geographical area of India only . But I don't think whether it will gain much popularity if they have not supported or developed a plugin for GNU/Linux or in common \*nix systems . I think many of the Indians are now opensource lovers and have moved to \*nix platform . So the ISRO which is a goverment body must really support the opensource projects rather than developing something for properitery OS. Now the web is a platform which makes the OS independent . So try to make something which is not an OS dependent software .  I hope they may come with a plugin for \*nix systems . I would like to explore Bhuvan after that , and now its not an answer for Google earth . Google earth can be viewed from \*nix systems .  This is for ISRO people ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) , track your site vistors Operating system and Browser and compare . You can see the difference . Google analytics is a good one or you can go for piwik an opensource web analytics tool .

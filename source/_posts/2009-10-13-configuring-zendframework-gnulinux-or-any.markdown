I got some request from some people asking how to configure / install zendframework 1.9 . Though its easy to do, I thought of writing it as some one who is lookingmay get some help . If you are new configuring PHP consider installing LAMP , WAMP or XAMPP . XAMPP comes with zend framework . So no need to do much work . If you in GNU/Linux you can go and get php , apache , mysql , phpmyadmin through synaptic or mannually download and configure it .  1 ) I hope you have the server LAMP or WAMP or MAMP is ready and running .  2 ) If you are using GNU/Linux use the command locate php.ini file , windows guys search it , you don't need commands right ?  Open it in your editor . GNU/Linux guys can do in vim or gedit . Search for the keyword include\_path and add your zend framework location . I assume it as /var/ZendFramework/library . You can place anywhere and its not a big deal .  ; UNIX: "/path1:/path2" ;include\_path = ".:/usr/share/php" include\_path = ".:/var/ZendFramework/library" ; ; Windows: "\\path1;\\path2" ;include\_path = ".;c:\\php\\includes"  As I am from GNU/Linux I uncommented the line and added the path where the zendframework library is located . Windows guys can add your folder path to zendframework library .  3 ) Now you have done . If you need the zf command , then you have to do some more .  Make a symbolic link and place in the /bin . That is \# ln -s /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh /bin/zf  If you are in windows you need to add environment variables ( Right click on My computer - \> Properties -\> Settings tab ( I think ) Don't ask me more about it , you may need to google search. Search for adding environment variables in java , as the process is same ) . So will be easy to run command from any where as \# zf <command\> . Else you may need to give the full path where zendframework is placed. Like  /var/ZendFramework/bin/zf.sh or c:\\ZendFramework\\bin\\zf.bat if you are in windows . ( Hope you have zendframework in c drive ) .  Now its ready to use your zendframework 1.9 for your projects . You have successfully installed and configured your Zendframework 1.9 . Any trouble in GNU/Linux let me know . I will help you configuring it .  \*Note : You must be root and must restart apache after you have done completely .

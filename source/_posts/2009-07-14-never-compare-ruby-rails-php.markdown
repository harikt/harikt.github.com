All may be hearing about the buzz word Ruby on Rails. So I thought to peep into What Ruby on Rails is . I thought of getting exited by Ruby on Rails , so watched the video [http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails\_blog\_2.mov](http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov) . Yes I was really excited.  But can we compare Ruby on Rails with PHP ? Never you should not compare Ruby on Rails with PHP. Then Why isnt ?  Yes , PHP  and Ruby are two languages used for web-development . Rails is a MVC framework for the programming language Ruby . There are lots of frameworks for PHP like the zend framework from the supporters of PHP , yii , symfony , PHPCake , Code Ignitter and much more . You can see similar examples to get excited in PHP frameworks . So you can compare rubyonrails with zend-framework , code-ignitter , yii , symfony or any . PHP has a wide range of frameworks , does Ruby have something like this ? I don't know . So sorry .  I have read in a blog why Ruby on Rails went to some what popular . Its mainly because, at that time PHP was not purely object oriented. I don't remember where I read about it . Anyway one was in [phpclasses.org](http://www.phpclasses.org) . Manuel Lemo has made it some what clear about it .  Recently I was arguing with one of my collegue that , PHP is secure, but you need to code it correctly . He told me that PHP lags security . Yes, it may lacks security when you code not propery . As the web now adays is dynamic and getting information from users, you should properly validate the inputs, else it may cause a serious damage to the site and server ( I agree , its not only the case of PHP , every web ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif) ) .  PHP now adays have good number of frameworks which will do almost all things to make secure . But its very sad that many of the PHP developers are still using without frameworks . Frameworks increases the productivity . No one knows the working of many sites, but many of the websites are insecure .  The developers need to be careful and should know the attacks that will happen to a website when its live . But many people fails to do the necessary actions. Your design may look good , but it may lags security ![image](http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/devil_smile.gif) . So try to move using some nice frameworks .  So PHP  with some frameworks can be compared with rubyonrails .

Recently I was viewing Tech crunch site at techcrunch.com .Â  There was a post claiming about the new advertisement made by Oracle in the European edition of the Wall Street Journal . You may love to see the advertisement . We can call this as a comedy or something serious or like a warning in lighter words .  [![Oracle and sun advertisement a comedy](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/3906567985_265ae36bdf.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3906567985/)  Its such a beautiful quotes . I hope you may have enjoyed this . If you are interested to know more do visit the oracle site http://www.oracle.com/features/suncustomers.html . Don't know how long will it be there .
